# About app:

This is my first java app that I was not ashamed to share on github ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Made on February 7, 2022
The main purpose of this app was to study recursion and a bit of classes dealing with filesystem.
The insides of the main class should have abdundant explanation on how the app works.
As this is public project shared on github, developers are free to copy/paste my code in case they find it useful.
